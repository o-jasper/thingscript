# Command `help_browser`
Same as the command help, but uses markdown to generate a html file and opens it
with the browser indicated in `thingscript cat_get prefer/browser`. 

If nothing is indicated, it uses `xdg-open`.(it does file type - application 
association)

Effectively does:

    thingscript cat_get help/$INPUT > some.html
    `thingscript cat_get prefer/browser` some.html

If in the future css will be added to make the pages nices, it will be in
 `prefer/help_browser.css`.

## Notes
Currently leaves some crap in `/tmp/thingscript/`.
