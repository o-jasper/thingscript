# Command `help_browser`
Same as the command help, but uses a the browser in [prefer/browser].

**The html docs contain the same functionality statically and may be
 more convenient!** It contains links between the different pages.

If nothing is indicated, it uses `xdg-open`.(it does file type - application 
association)

Roughly does:

    thingscript cat_get help/$INPUT > some.html
    `thingscript cat_get prefer/browser` some.html

If in the future css will be added to make the pages nicer, it will be in
 `prefer/help_browser.css`.

## Notes
Currently leaves some crap in `/tmp/thingscript/`.
