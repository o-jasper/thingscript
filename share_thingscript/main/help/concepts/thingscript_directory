# Concept: Thing*script* directories
Thing*script* directories are directories where 
<a href="$al get$"><code>thingscript get ...</code></a> searches,

It searches in sequence the `:`-separated entries of $ac_var THINGSCRIPT_PATH$ 
until it finds a matching file.

### The default
The default has `thingscript/` as first entry, it is relative to the 
$a_concept thing_directory$, it is particular to
the thing in question.

The $ac_var THINGSCRIPT_ADDITIONAL_PATH$ to allow easier interaction with the default,
and then <code>/home/$a_var USER$/.thingscript/$a_var WHICH_TYPE$</code> and
 <code>/home/$a_var USER$/.thingscript_share/$a_var WHICH_TYPE$</code> for user 
 modifications and local installs respectively, and then `/etc/thingscript` and
`/usr/share/thingscript/$WHICH_TYPE`, resp. global settings and installed settings.

### Uses
Basically it is a hierarchical sequence of values. The top ones are 
modifications/information on the local case, then come some sort of preferences,
then stuff based on what is installed. In the future a layer of 'libraries of stuff'
may also follow.

### Example of another THINGSCRIPT_PATH sequence
Currently there is one other example, the help system itself has static html
output based on it, to generate this help an alternative 
<code>$a_var THINGSCRIPT_PATH$=helpmaker</code>. 
(though if more of the thingscript directory `main` is used, it may be appended again)
