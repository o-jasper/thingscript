# Command `help`
Provides help about a command or file. Outputs it to stdout, in (human readable)
markdown. To view the html of this directly, use `help_browser`.

Roughly: `thingscript cat_get help/$ASKED_PAGE`

More specifically, it uses `test -d $cat_get_result` to see if it is a directory
and if it is, opens the `readme.md` there.
