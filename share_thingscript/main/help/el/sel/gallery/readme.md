Gallery is extensible. $a gallery_list$ is essentially a list of commands,
these commands are the programs listed here. The first argument is suggested to
be the item shown. 

And no complicated commands made, instead make a program here, well not exactly
_here_ but note $a concept/hierarchical_files$.

The programs standard output is used as html.
