Gallery is extensible. $a gallery_list$ is essentially a list of commands,
these commands are the programs listed here. The first argument is suggested to
be the item shown. 

And no complicated commands made, instead make a program here, well not exactly
_here_ but found via searching in the list as in the concept 
$a_concept thingscript_directory$.

The programs standard output is used as html.
