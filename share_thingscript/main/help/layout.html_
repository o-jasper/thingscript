File `layout.html_`, `layout.md_`, (or `layout`, `layout.md`, `layout.html`,
but you have to end it in `_` for it to work)

First file that is `handle`d, which is effectively a layout because `handle`
looks for commands between `$` replacing using stdout of those commands.
(Those commands are in the elements directory; `el/`)
