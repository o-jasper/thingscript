# Project thingscript files

Project thingscript files are files that are intended to be per-project.
For instance a project has a title, development link, its own list for the 
gallery.

On the other hand, the author could be in the user configuration. Basically 
there is a continuum;

* belonging to a particular project, 
* being preferences of a user
* being a 'theme' or some kind of set of settings
* being a pregiven default
* 'code'
