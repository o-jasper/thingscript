# Command `ibin`
Runs one of the 'internal programs', basically these are parts of thingscript
of which it was decided they could be separate from the rest, like a program.

As such, it may form an example for the thing it does.(for instance using stl2pov)

`thingscript ibin list` gets you a list of these programs.
