This program makes the representation file.

Usage: `thingscript mk page thing_dir/`

It will demand that some files to exist, the intention of those is that they go in 
`thingscript/`. Some things are really data of a particular thing, and perhaps in
 the future having them elsewhere will trigger an error.

As usual information on the demanded files can be found with
`thingscript help $the_file` or `thingscript help_browser $dollar$the_file`, hopefully 
eventually all of them.

I suggest you try it on `testpage/` with `thingscript mk page testfile/`.
 You can also look at it as an example.
