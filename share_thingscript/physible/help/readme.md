This is thingscript, currently a project to help create pages representing
(3d)printable designs.

Please mind, it is still in early development.

Use `thingscript help <thingscript_command or 'file relative to thingscript'>`
for help topics. For instance `thingscript help help`.
TODO 'file relative to thingscript' is?
