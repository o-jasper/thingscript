This is [thingscript](https://github.com/o-jasper/thingscript), currently a 
project to help create pages representing (3d)printable designs.

Please mind, it is still in early development.

Use <code>thingscript help thingscript command or <thingscript_command or '$a_concept thingscript_file$'></code>
for help topics. For instance `thingscript help help`.
