# Concept: Thingscript directories
Thing*script* directories are directories where 
<a href="$al get$"><code>thingscript get ...</code></a> searches,

It searches in sequence the `:`-separated entries of $ac_var THINGSCRIPT_PATH$ 
until it finds a matching file. 

*However*, a better way to change this path is 
through $ac_var THINGSCRIPT_TYPE$, which is a set of 'kinds' of things, it 
generates a `THINGSCRIPT_PATH` that iterates `~/.thingscript/`, 
`/etc/thingscript/`, `/etc/thingscript_share/`, `/usr/share/thingscript/`,
it always looks at 'plain' `thingscript/` in the local directory.

The $ac_var THINGSCRIPT_ADDITIONAL_PATH$ to allow easier interaction with the default,

### Uses
Basically it is a hierarchical sequence of values, and which 'kinds of stuff' are 
included is controlled by `THINGSCRIPT_TYPE` . The top ones are 
modifications/information on the local case, then come some sort of preferences,
then stuff based on what is installed. In the future a layer of 'libraries of stuff'
may also follow.

### Example of another `THINGSCRIPT_PATH` sequence
Currently there is one other example, the help system itself has static html
output based on it, to generate this help an alternative 
`THINGSCRIPT_PATH=helpmaker`
(though if more of the thingscript directory `main` is used, it may be appended again)
