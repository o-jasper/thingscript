NOTE: **gathering thoughts**.. (not real documentation at this point)

What does a website need?

* On each page
  + Menu, in different fashions.(primarily, to left side imo)
  + Top banner.
  + Title, tags, categories.
  + Last update.

* Style.(`.css` does that) I also kindah want selectable style.

* About page.
* Blog-style thingy.(possibly multiple, across different categorizations.)
  `.rss` or some such. Each blog page:
  + Which categories is it in?
  + Previous, next
  + Initial publish
