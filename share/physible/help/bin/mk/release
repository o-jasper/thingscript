Makes a release by using the list `thingscript/release_files`, which contains
regular expressions.(as globs)

Usage: `thingscript mk release thing_dir/ [release_name]`

The compression used for the release is in
 `thingscript/prefer/release_compress`, the value `.zip` is used by default.

If `release_name` is not provided it uses an incrementing value in `version_n`
combined with the `thing_dir` directory name.
