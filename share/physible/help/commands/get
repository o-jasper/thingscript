# Command `get`

Gets data about the page and settings/preferences. The arguments are a list of
files (that may have directories, but none absolute) of which one must match.

It searches relative to some directory, first looking higher up: 
* Thing directory; `$dollar$THING_DIRECTORY/thingscript/`
* User level preferences; `~/.thingscript/$dollar$WHICH_TYPE/`
* System level preferences `/etc/thingsscript/$dollar$WHICH_TYPE/`
* Defaults build in: `/usr/share/thingscript/$dollar$WHICH_TYPE/`

Here, `$dollar$WHICH_TYPE` is defaultly `main`, this is for possible future totally
different kinds of things. The reason the thing directory doesnt have it, is 
that it has some kind already.

If the file isnt found, it will fall back to `main`.(if not already there)
