# Command `help`
Provides help about a command or file. Outputs it to stdout, in (human readable)
markdown. There are static html pages that might be more convenient to view.

Roughly: `thingscript cat_get help/ASKED_PAGE`

Change $a prefer/help_default$ to `browser` to make `thingscript help ...`
defaultly use the browser.
