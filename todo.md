* Put a lot of the data in files now in a json file and make a 
  html+javascript page that generates that json.

* Relies on javascript.. I dont like javascripts in the webs myself! If possible
  get the javascript out of the gallery.(not sure if possible) As good is to 
  give the user control over the javascript and when it updates. For instance
  with a [userscript](http://userscript.org/) that can detect-and-replace, or
  convince browser developpers to affect the standards as to add a 'JS library'
  system in order to give users more control.

* More/better .css for defaults.

* Make more things representable (see `have.md`) and handle (lack)of dependencies.

* Stl-javascript php is slow. (And it is php....) Make C version or something.

* Some of the stuff in `thingscript_share/main/scripts/` could be better organized..
  It is basically a kind of `on_absence`

* Lay out principles better.

* In retrospect I dont really like the linux-like file structure in
  `share_thingscript/rootlike`, 
   make it organized both by function(like in linux), and by
   entity(more windows-like) with symlinks.
