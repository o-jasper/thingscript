* More .css for defaults.

* Better/more consistent list parsing.

* Make more things representable (see `have.md`)

* Lay out some principles.

* In retrospect I dont really like the linux-like file structure in
  `share_thingscript/rootlike`, 
   make it organized both by function(like in linux), and by
   entity(more windows-like) with symlinks.

* More todo items.
